            <p>The mission is a test: at some point in 2023, Space Safari (a part of the US Space Force) will tell
                Firefly Aerospace that it needs to launch a satellite. The launch service provider will then have just
                24 hours to get it into orbit â€” demonstrating the US's ability to rapidly replace a downed satellite.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Most of the importnt things in the world have accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there
                seemed to be no hope att all. All our derams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.</p>

            <h2>target</h2>
            <p>If you are unwilling to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary. There is one thing
                that 99% of failures and successful people have in commone: they all hate doing the same things. the
                difference is successful people do them anymore.</p>

            <p>Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage, and confidence in the doing. Never give up,try
                Hard work hard. Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better Than any one.</p>

            <p>Ordinary people think merely lf spending time great people think of using it. Repetition can be boring of
                tedious- which is why so few people ever master anything. thr public sees only the thriil of the
                accomplished task; they have no comception of the tortous preliminary self-trainin that was necessary to
                conquer fear.</p>
